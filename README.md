## 📚 Project Overview

This project was created as part of the **Ackee Solana School** program. The task was to build a complete decentralized application (dApp) on Solana that demonstrates the skills learned throughout the course.

## 🎯 Task Requirements

The assignment required building:

1. **Anchor Program** - A deployed Solana program using PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
2. **React Frontend** - A simple frontend to interact with the dApp
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - TypeScript tests covering both happy and unhappy scenarios
4. **Deployment** - Both program and frontend deployed and accessible

## 🚀 What I Built

I chose to create a **Decentralized Blog dApp** that includes:

- **User Profiles** with custom handles (usernames)
- **Blog Posts** with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **PDA-based Architecture** for secure and deterministic account management
- **Modern React Frontend** with wallet integration
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** covering all functionality

## 📁 Project Structure

- `anchor-project/blog/` - The Solana Anchor program
- `frontend/` - React frontend application
- `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` - Detailed project documentation

## 🔗 Live Demo

- **Frontend**: https://frontend-ow4rd3lfk-routineforbots-projects.vercel.app
- **Program ID**: `9uTQy7AX7qd9xHDzcbK1mkraGPAMT7G3o1h2Ei8i4rAZ` (Solana Devnet)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Anchor Framework** for Solana program development
- **React + Vite** for the frontend
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Phantom Wallet** for blockchain interaction
- **Vercel** for frontend deployment

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

This project was my first Solana dApp and provided hands-on experience with:
- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Account ownership and authorization
- Transaction handling and error management
- Frontend-blockchain integration
- Testing decentralized applications
